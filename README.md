# Potato_Leaf_Disease_Detection
This project implements a deep learning–based system for potato leaf disease detection. It compares a Custom CNN and MobileNetV2 model to classify leaf images into Early Blight, Late Blight, and Healthy categories, and deploys the trained models through a web-based application for real-time inference.
